# Classification-Model-Optimisation-with-Random-Forest-and-Stacking-Techniques.
Developed decision tree models using Scikit-learn to predict customer satisfaction in a Kaggle competition.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key features and eliminate irrelevant variables, improving model efficiency.
Optimized model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters such as tree depth and splitting criteria.
Evaluated multiple models by submitting predictions to Kaggle, analyzing rankings, and comparing results using Python and Excel.
Addressed challenges like imbalanced data and feature dependencies, enhancing model accuracy and generalization.
