# Classification-Model-Optimisation-with-Random-Forest-and-Stacking-Techniques.
This project involved predicting customer satisfaction using decision tree models in a Kaggle competition. Using Scikit-learn, we optimized hyperparameters, performed EDA, and analyzed feature relevance. Multiple models were evaluated using Kaggle rankings, enhancing accuracy and insights into real-world ML workflows.
